In this repo you can find my Python scripts, which I developed as part of my training as a data analyst at CareerFoundry.

## About the Project "Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis"
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task as a data analyst for Instacart was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.


### Tools 

Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn), in Jupyter Notebook. 

### Key Questions: 

* The busiest days of the week and hours of the day 
* Particular times of the day when people spend the most money

* different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. 
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customerâ€™s loyalty status?
